Mephisto makes crowdsourcing easier.

We provide a platform for launching, monitoring, and reviewing your crowdsourcing tasks. Tasks made on Mephisto can easily be open sourced as part of other projects.

As of now we're in an early alpha release, more details to come. See our in-progress docs at [mephisto.ai](https://mephisto.ai).
